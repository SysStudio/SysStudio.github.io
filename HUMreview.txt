Two Frogs - Page
  good moral to the story

  improve eye contact

The Nightengale - Harmony
  good projection and well chosen story

  seemed a little nervous

Hansil and Gretel - Micheal
  great new way to retell an old story
  good placement for the pause

  the ending was left open but not in a way that benifits the story
