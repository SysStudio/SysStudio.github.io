## A Huge Update
![logoopaqueweb.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/media/logoopaqueweb.jpg)

We have been hard at work on our upcoming game Skyraiders. I have not posted any updates in months so there is a lot to cover... We changed our name to Lonely Rock Studio. We have officially entered production. We started animation and voice acting along with working in Unreal on the upcoming alpha for Skyraiders, more to come on that. Writing for the main plot has been finished, and Aly is currently forming the script. The website will also soon be overhauled.
