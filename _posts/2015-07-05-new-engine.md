We are Excited to officially announce Unreal4 as our new engine for our upcoming title Skyraiders. We have been working this week on porting our current development and pipeline. This should allow use to spend a lot less time working on the engine and more time on the game itself. We are sad to see Neo Engine go after working with it for the last year, but we looking forward to new possibilities with Unreal.
