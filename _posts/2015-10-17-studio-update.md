## Studio Update
It's been awhile since our last update so here we go.
John was made the art producer a few weeks back and brought on a B team of artists to help us out. Here is a shoutout to Eleasha, Sabryn, Tucker, and Javier you have all been a big help in the last few
weeks.
Our Writers Doug, Ally, and John have started the last revision of the story before scripting. We now are busy at work putting the first 15min of the game together. Allek started puting together music for
the start of the game. We also have 2 new 3d characters that are almost out of production here is a little sneak peak.
